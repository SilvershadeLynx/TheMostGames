Hello there! I am Maya the Bee! And today is a very special day: It's my birthday!
Therefore, I would like to invite all my friends over! Because they are all so honeysweet!
We still need a lot of things to make this the most sun-tastic party in the whole poppy field. Will you help me prepare?
You have a new gift for me!
You've unlocked new food for the party!
A new party entertainer has arrived!
You've unlocked a new party decoration!
Have a close look around - somebody new wants to play hide and seek with you.
Now the party is really starting to get going!
This is a great party!
This is the best party ever!
Well done!
Super job!
Excellent!
Awesome!
Great!
Fantastic!
Perfect!
Congratulations!
That was brilliant!
You’re the best!
That was impressive!
You are smart!
That was outstanding work!
Oops, try again.
Let’s try that one more time.
That was close.
You can do better than that.
If you try a litte more you can do it.
Let's make this an exiting party by playing some music. Give musical instruments to the band members to let them play this instrument.
Try giving an instrument to a Band member.
Now give instruments to everybody and see how the music changes.
Try different combinations of instruments to create interesting musical variations.
The drums sound lonely by themselves. Try giving a band member an instrument to play.
Experiment with different instruments to change the music in interesting ways.
Why don’t you try giving Flip an instrument?
